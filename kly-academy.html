    <div class="module-title">Module 1: What is DeFi?</div>
    <div class="module-content">
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is a revolutionary shift in the global financial system. Instead of relying on banks, DeFi uses blockchain technology to give you direct access to your money and financial tools.</p>

      <h3>Objectives</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Understand what DeFi is and how it works</li>
        <li>Learn the benefits of decentralization</li>
        <li>Recognize the risks and responsibilities of DeFi</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Core Concepts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Blockchain:</strong> A digital ledger where every transaction is recorded transparently.</li>
        <li><strong>Smart Contracts:</strong> Self-executing agreements coded on the blockchain.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-Custodial:</strong> You control your funds — not a bank or third party.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why DeFi Matters</h3>
      <p>Traditional finance is often restrictive, expensive, and slow. DeFi removes gatekeepers, reduces fees, and opens access to wealth tools for anyone with a crypto wallet.</p>

      <h3>Real-World Example</h3>
      <p>Imagine lending your crypto directly to someone in Brazil and earning interest — without a bank, credit check, or delay. DeFi makes this possible in seconds, globally.</p>

      <h3>KLY Integration Tip</h3>
      <p>KLY is a utility token built to empower DeFi education and wealth access. Holding KLY gives you access to private courses, governance, and platform rewards.</p>

      <blockquote>“DeFi is finance by the people, for the people.”</blockquote>

    <div class="module-title">Module 2: Setting Up Your Wallet</div>
    <div class="module-content">
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Your wallet is your passport to the DeFi world. It allows you to store crypto, connect to decentralized apps (dApps), and interact directly with the blockchain. In this module, you'll set up a wallet and learn how to use it securely.</p>

      <h3>Objectives</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Understand the role of DeFi wallets</li>
        <li>Create and back up your first wallet</li>
        <li>Safely fund and connect your wallet to Web3 platforms</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Step-by-Step: Creating Your Wallet</h3>

      <h4>Step 1: Choose a Wallet</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>MetaMask:</strong> Popular browser and mobile wallet (supports Ethereum, BNB, etc.)</li>
        <li><strong>Trust Wallet:</strong> Mobile-first wallet with multi-chain support</li>
        <li><strong>Coinbase Wallet:</strong> Separate from Coinbase exchange, ideal for beginners</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Step 2: Install the Wallet</h4>
      <p>Go to the official website or app store:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://metamask.io" target="_blank">MetaMask.io</a></li>
        <li>Or download from Google Play / Apple App Store</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Step 3: Save Your Secret Phrase</h4>
      <p>Write down the 12- or 24-word recovery phrase shown during setup. This is your backup key. If you lose it, you lose access. Never store it digitally or share it with anyone.</p>

      <h4>Step 4: Fund Your Wallet</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Send BNB (for Binance Smart Chain) or ETH (for Ethereum) from a centralized exchange</li>
        <li>You can also receive funds from another wallet</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Step 5: Connect to a dApp</h4>
      <p>Visit any Web3 platform like <strong>kellylegacyestates.com</strong> and click "Connect Wallet." Approve the prompt from your wallet app.</p>

      <h3>Best Practices for Wallet Security</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Always check the website URL before connecting</li>
        <li>Use a hardware wallet for large amounts (e.g., Ledger or Trezor)</li>
        <li>Never share your seed phrase</li>
        <li>Enable password and biometric protection</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Real-World Example</h3>
      <p>John sets up MetaMask, transfers $100 in BNB from Binance, and connects to PancakeSwap. Within minutes, he's swapping tokens and exploring the DeFi ecosystem — no bank needed.</p>

      <h3>KLY Integration Tip</h3>
      <p>To access advanced features on the KLY platform (like minting certificates or launching a token), you'll need a DeFi wallet with KLY tokens. Wallet connection is required to unlock your full course journey.</p>

    <div class="module-title">Module 3: Using Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)</div>
    <div class="module-content">

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) allow users to trade cryptocurrencies without relying on a centralized intermediary. Trades happen directly between wallets using smart contracts, providing you full control and privacy.</p>

      <h3>Objectives</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Understand how DEXs operate vs. centralized exchanges</li>
        <li>Learn to swap tokens securely using your wallet</li>
        <li>Explore top DEX platforms on BNB and Ethereum networks</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Step-by-Step: Trading on a DEX</h3>

      <h4>Step 1: Connect Your Wallet</h4>
      <p>Visit a trusted DEX (e.g., PancakeSwap or Uniswap) and click <strong>"Connect Wallet."</strong> Approve the connection in your wallet app (like MetaMask).</p>

      <h4>Step 2: Choose Your Tokens</h4>
      <p>Select the token you want to swap (e.g., BNB) and the token you want to receive (e.g., KLY). Enter the amount.</p>

      <h4>Step 3: Review and Swap</h4>
      <p>Click <strong>"Swap"</strong> and confirm the transaction. Your wallet will prompt for gas fee approval. Once confirmed, the trade executes and tokens appear in your wallet.</p>

      <h3>Popular DEX Platforms</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://pancakeswap.finance" target="_blank">PancakeSwap</a> – Best for BNB Chain (low fees)</li>
        <li><a href="https://uniswap.org" target="_blank">Uniswap</a> – Ethereum-based, pioneer of DEX trading</li>
        <li><a href="https://app.1inch.io" target="_blank">1inch</a> – Finds the best swap rates across multiple DEXs</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What You'll Need</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A connected wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.)</li>
        <li>BNB (for BNB Chain) or ETH (for Ethereum) to cover gas fees</li>
        <li>Some crypto to swap</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Benefits of Using a DEX</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>100% control of your funds — no custody risk</li>
        <li>No registration, KYC, or personal data</li>
        <li>Access to early-stage and community tokens like KLY</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Real-World Example</h3>
      <p>Jane connects to PancakeSwap with her Trust Wallet, swaps BNB for KLY, and receives KLY instantly — no account, no delay, no bank required.</p>

      <h3>KLY Integration Tip</h3>
      <p>You can trade into KLY directly from PancakeSwap using the BNB/KLY pair. Add the official token address from the KLY dashboard to make sure you're swapping the correct token.</p>

    <div class="module-title">Module 4: Earning with DeFi (Yield & Lending)</div>
    <div class="module-content">

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>One of the most powerful opportunities in DeFi is the ability to earn passive income through staking, lending, and yield farming. These methods let you grow your crypto without needing to actively trade.</p>

      <h3>Objectives</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Understand how DeFi generates yield</li>
        <li>Learn the differences between staking, lending, and yield farming</li>
        <li>Explore platforms that offer passive income opportunities</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>1. Staking</h3>
      <p>Staking involves locking your tokens in a smart contract to support a network or protocol. In return, you earn rewards — usually in the same token.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Example:</strong> Stake KLY tokens to earn more KLY over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Platforms:</strong> KLY Platform, PancakeSwap Syrup Pools</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Lending</h3>
      <p>With DeFi lending, you deposit tokens into a lending pool. Borrowers take loans from the pool and pay interest, which is distributed to lenders like you.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Example:</strong> Lend BUSD on Venus or Aave and earn 5–12% APY</li>
        <li><strong>Assets:</strong> Stablecoins (BUSD, USDT), BNB, ETH, etc.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Yield Farming</h3>
      <p>Yield farming involves providing liquidity to a DEX and earning rewards from trading fees and bonus tokens. It's higher risk but can offer higher returns.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Example:</strong> Add KLY/USDT liquidity to PancakeSwap and earn LP rewards</li>
        <li><strong>Risk Note:</strong> You may face impermanent loss — make sure to understand the mechanics</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Top Platforms to Explore</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://app.venus.io" target="_blank">Venus</a> – Lending & borrowing on BNB Chain</li>
        <li><a href="https://pancakeswap.finance" target="_blank">PancakeSwap</a> – Staking and farming</li>
        <li><a href="https://aave.com" target="_blank">Aave</a> – Lending on Ethereum and Polygon</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Tips for Earning Safely</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Always start small and test the platform before depositing large amounts</li>
        <li>Look for audited smart contracts and community trust</li>
        <li>Track your yield and set long-term goals</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Real-World Example</h3>
      <p>Marcus stakes 5,000 KLY on the Kelly Legacy Platform. In 30 days, he earns 250 KLY in staking rewards — all without trading or selling.</p>

      <h3>KLY Integration Tip</h3>
      <p>Use the <strong>Liberty Pool</strong> on PancakeSwap to provide KLY/USDT liquidity and farm LP tokens. Stakers also gain governance power in the KLY DAO.</p>

    <div class="module-title">Module 5: DeFi Safety & Long-Term Strategy</div>
    <div class="module-content">

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>DeFi offers freedom, but also places responsibility in your hands. This module teaches you how to avoid scams, secure your wallet, and build a sustainable strategy for growing your digital wealth over time.</p>

      <h3>Objectives</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Learn the most common DeFi risks and how to avoid them</li>
        <li>Master wallet safety and identity protection</li>
        <li>Build a long-term crypto investment strategy</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>1. Common DeFi Risks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rugpulls:</strong> A scam where developers drain a project's liquidity and disappear</li>
        <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> Fake links or messages that trick you into sharing wallet access</li>
        <li><strong>Smart Contract Bugs:</strong> Code vulnerabilities hackers can exploit</li>
        <li><strong>Impermanent Loss:</strong> A loss in value from providing liquidity to unstable pairs</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Safety Tips</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Only use verified links and bookmark your favorite DeFi platforms</li>
        <li>Never share your recovery phrase — not even with "support agents"</li>
        <li>Use a hardware wallet (e.g., Ledger or Trezor) for large holdings</li>
        <li>Use burner wallets for testing new dApps</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Long-Term Strategy</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Diversify:</strong> Don't put all your assets in one protocol or token</li>
        <li><strong>Reinvest profits:</strong> Grow your staking, LP, or lending positions over time</li>
        <li><strong>Take profits:</strong> Periodically convert yield into stablecoins or reinvest wisely</li>
        <li><strong>Stay educated:</strong> Follow news, audits, and DAO governance updates</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>KLY Wealth Blueprint Tip</h3>
      <p>Once you've completed this course, stake your KLY or launch your own token via the <strong>KLY Launchpad</strong>. Use your NFT certificate to unlock bonus content and governance rights.</p>

          <div class="module-content">
            <h3>Theme: Becoming the Observer</h3>
            <p>This module is your gateway to awakening. By cultivating the skill of witnessing without judgment, you begin to create spaciousness between your true Self and the mind's habitual noise. Awareness becomes the ground from which inner transformation unfolds.</p>

            <h3>Topics Covered</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>What is self-awareness?</strong><br />
                Self-awareness is the conscious ability to observe your thoughts, emotions, and behaviors without becoming them. It's the first step toward waking up from unconscious programming. When you're self-aware, you respond rather than react, and you see with clarity rather than assumption.
              </li>

              <li><strong>Mindfulness practices for daily life</strong><br />
                Mindfulness is the art of being fully present in this moment. We'll explore simple practices—like mindful eating, walking, or breathing—that anchor your attention into now. These tools sharpen awareness and reduce autopilot living.
              </li>

              <li><strong>Journaling for clarity and self-discovery</strong><br />
                Journaling is a sacred mirror. It allows you to witness the mind on paper and access insights buried beneath mental chatter. You'll learn prompts and techniques that turn journaling into a portal for healing, reflection, and intuitive guidance.
              </li>

              <li><strong>Identifying unconscious patterns and inherited beliefs</strong><br />
                Much of our identity is inherited—cultural, familial, or societal stories that shape how we see the world. This section helps you uncover beliefs you didn't consciously choose, and begin dismantling those that no longer serve your growth or truth.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Practice</h3>
            <p><strong>5-minute Breath + Journaling Meditation:</strong><br />
            Sit quietly and observe your breath for 5 minutes, noting each inhale and exhale. Afterward, journal what surfaced—thoughts, emotions, sensations—without censorship. Simply witness and record.</p>

            <h3>Homework</h3>
            <p><strong>Belief Audit Worksheet:</strong><br />
            List at least 3 core beliefs you've carried about yourself, others, or life. For each belief, ask:
            <ul>
              <li>Where did I learn this?</li>
              <li>Is it absolutely true?</li>
              <li>How do I act when I believe it?</li>
              <li>Who would I be without it?</li>
            </ul>
            This inquiry initiates the unlearning process and invites greater freedom.</p>

            <h3>Theme: You Are Not Your Story</h3>
            <p>This module invites you to see through the false self—the mental image you've built through identity, labels, roles, and stories. Awakening begins when you realize: the one observing your story is not the story itself.</p>

            <h3>Topics Covered</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Understanding Ego vs. Essence</strong><br />
                The ego is not the enemy, but it's also not who you are. It's a mental structure built from fear, separation, and survival. Your essence, in contrast, is pure awareness—unchanging, loving, and infinite. This lesson clarifies the difference and why ego must be seen clearly, not suppressed.
              </li>

              <li><strong>The Trap of Roles, Labels, and Identity</strong><br />
                "I am a healer." "I am broken." "I am a failure." These are not truths; they are masks. We'll explore how identification limits expansion and how attachment to identity—even spiritual ones—can quietly reinforce ego rather than dissolve it.
              </li>

              <li><strong>The Silent Watcher: Meeting Your True Self</strong><br />
                Beneath all thoughts and identities lies a quiet, spacious presence that simply watches. That's you—the real you. Through guided inquiry and stillness, you'll begin to rest in that awareness more deeply, even amidst activity.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Practice</h3>
            <p><strong>"Who Am I?" Self-Inquiry Meditation:</strong><br />
              Sit in silence and ask inwardly: "Who am I?" Let each answer that arises—job, role, name, belief—be seen and released. Gently return to the question again and again until all that remains is presence itself.
            </p>

            <h3>Reflection Exercise</h3>
            <p><strong>Ego-Story Release:</strong><br />
              Write down a personal story you've identified with (e.g., "I'm not enough," "I always sabotage," "I have to prove myself"). Then ask:
              <ul>
                <li>Who would I be without this story?</li>
                <li>What's the cost of holding onto it?</li>
                <li>Am I willing to let it go, even just for today?</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Theme: Presence is Power</h3>
            <p>The present moment is not just a concept—it is the only place where life actually happens. In this module, we explore how to return home to now, again and again, and discover the stillness and power that lives beneath mental time.</p>

            <h3>Topics Covered</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>The Mind's Obsession with Past and Future</strong><br />
                The ego survives by constantly pulling your attention away from the present—rehashing the past, anticipating the future. Awareness of this pattern is the beginning of liberation. When you bring consciousness to the now, ego loses its grip.
              </li>

              <li><strong>Anchoring in the Breath and Senses</strong><br />
                Your body is always in the present. By tuning into breath, sound, sight, and touch, you shift from thinking to sensing—from story to stillness. You'll learn grounding practices to return to now throughout your day.
              </li>

              <li><strong>Listening as a Gateway to Stillness</strong><br />
                Deep listening—without mentally rehearsing your reply or analyzing—opens you to presence. When you truly listen, ego quiets and awareness expands. This practice can transform how you relate to others and yourself.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Practice</h3>
            <p><strong>Presence Scan + Nature-Based Stillness:</strong><br />
              Choose a moment in nature (even a tree, breeze, or sunlight will do). Observe it with full attention. Let your mind rest. Scan your body gently from head to toe, noticing each sensation. Whenever thoughts arise, lovingly return to the now.
            </p>

            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p><strong>24-Hour Presence Challenge:</strong><br />
              For one full day, use every "in-between" moment—waiting, walking, eating—as a cue to return to the now. No fixing, no analyzing. Just presence. Record insights or resistances that arise.
            </p>

            <h3>Theme: Freedom Through Letting Go</h3>
            <p>This module is about release—not through force, but through allowing. You'll learn the difference between spiritual bypassing and true surrender, and how to transform emotions into insight by fully meeting them without resistance.</p>

            <h3>Topics Covered</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>What is Surrender (vs. Giving Up)?</strong><br />
                Surrender isn't weakness—it's conscious alignment with what is. Giving up comes from fear; surrender arises from trust. You'll explore what it means to stop struggling and allow life to move through you with intelligence.
              </li>

              <li><strong>Allowing Emotions to Move Without Attachment</strong><br />
                Emotions are energy. They arise, peak, and dissolve—if you let them. Resistance creates suffering. This section teaches you how to feel emotions fully without clinging to their story or pushing them away.
              </li>

              <li><strong>Accepting Impermanence and Imperfection</strong><br />
                Everything changes. Nothing is static. By embracing impermanence, you free yourself from the illusion of control. True peace isn't found in perfection—it's found in presence with what is, as it is.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Practice</h3>
            <p><strong>Guided Emotion-Release Meditation:</strong><br />
              Sit quietly. Bring attention to an emotion you've been avoiding or controlling. Name it. Locate it in your body. Breathe into it. Let it be exactly as it is. Don't fix or analyze—just feel. Stay with the energy until it shifts or softens.
            </p>

            <h3>Assignment</h3>
            <p><strong>Journal on Resistance + Peace with the Now:</strong><br />
              Reflect on something in your life you're currently resisting. Write about:
              <ul>
                <li>What am I afraid would happen if I surrendered?</li>
                <li>What deeper lesson might this moment be offering me?</li>
                <li>What would radical peace look like right now?</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Theme: Beyond Separation</h3>
            <p>This module invites you into the deepest truth of awakening: that we are not separate selves, but expressions of one infinite consciousness. When the illusion of "me vs. them" dissolves, compassion, unity, and deep peace naturally arise.</p>

            <h3>Topics Covered</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>The Illusion of Duality</strong><br />
                The mind divides: self and other, right and wrong, good and bad. But the truth is nondual. Awareness is one, appearing as many. This section explores how the ego depends on separation, and how awakening reveals the interconnectedness beneath it all.
              </li>

              <li><strong>Recognizing the Self in Others</strong><br />
                Every person you meet is a mirror. The traits you judge, love, or resist are reflections of unintegrated parts of your own being. By seeing the divine in others, you dissolve projections and return to wholeness.
              </li>

              <li><strong>Compassion as a Portal to Unity</strong><br />
                Compassion isn't sympathy—it's the felt knowing that we are one. As judgment softens, compassion naturally arises. It's not something you force—it's something you fall into when you see clearly.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Practice</h3>
            <p><strong>Loving-Kindness (Metta) Meditation:</strong><br />
              Bring to mind someone you love. Repeat silently: "May you be happy. May you be free. May you be at peace." Then bring in someone neutral. Then someone difficult. Finally, include yourself. Let the field of loving presence expand to all beings.
            </p>

            <h3>Group Reflection</h3>
            <p><strong>What Connects Us?</strong><br />
              In a group or solo journal session, reflect on this question:<br />
              "What do I share with all living beings, beneath our differences?"<br />
              Consider breath, awareness, emotions, desires, and fears—not as personal traits, but as universal experiences.
            </p>

            <h3>Theme: The Paradox of Awakening</h3>
            <p>This module reveals one of the most subtle traps on the spiritual path—the endless search for awakening itself. When seeking ends, presence begins. True realization isn't something you attain, but something you stop resisting.</p>

            <h3>Topics Covered</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Why Seeking Can Become Another Ego Trap</strong><br />
                The ego loves the idea of becoming "spiritual" or "awake." It will chase peak states, collect certifications, and perform enlightenment. But chasing implies lack—and your true nature was never missing. This lesson exposes the trap of spiritual seeking.
              </li>

              <li><strong>Letting Go of "Special" Spiritual Identities</strong><br />
                The more awakened you become, the less you need to be seen as awakened. This section invites you to drop the subtle ego identities of being "advanced," "gifted," or "different." Awakening is not a title—it's a disappearance into what already is.
              </li>

              <li><strong>Embracing Stillness, Simplicity, and Ordinariness</strong><br />
                Truth is not found in fireworks—it's found in the quiet. This is the paradox: the most profound awakening often feels like nothing at all. It's the return to the beauty of washing dishes, feeling the wind, and being completely here.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Practice</h3>
            <p><strong>Meditation on Being vs. Doing:</strong><br />
              Sit in silence with no goal. Every time the mind tries to "do" something—analyze, fix, achieve—gently return to just being. Allow the moment to be enough. Let life breathe through you without interference.
            </p>

            <h3>Prompt</h3>
            <p><strong>If I stopped chasing awakening, what would remain?</strong><br />
              Write freely for 10 minutes. Explore what is present when there's no effort to become anything—only the recognition of what already is.
            </p>

            <h3>Theme: Embodying the Truth</h3>
            <p>Awakening is not the end of the journey—it's the beginning of embodiment. In this final module, you'll explore how to live from truth in daily life: in relationships, in work, in service. This is the art of becoming the transmission, not just the student.</p>

            <h3>Topics Covered</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Integrating Awareness into Relationships, Work, and Service</strong><br />
                Presence isn't just for the meditation cushion. It wants to touch every part of your life. Learn how to meet others from stillness, infuse your work with integrity, and allow your gifts to serve the whole.
              </li>

              <li><strong>Responding Instead of Reacting</strong><br />
                When you're grounded in awareness, you're no longer triggered by every emotion or event. Instead, you meet life with clarity, calm, and compassion. This section teaches how to pause, breathe, and respond with consciousness.
              </li>

              <li><strong>Trusting Life's Intelligence — Surrender as Daily Practice</strong><br />
                Life is unfolding in ways the mind can't control. True embodiment means trusting that you don't need to micromanage the path. You listen, respond, and let life move through you—moment by moment.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Practice</h3>
            <p><strong>Silent Sitting + Intuitive Journaling:</strong><br />
              Begin with 10 minutes of silent sitting. No effort—just presence. Then pick up your journal and allow words to flow from that stillness. What wants to be expressed? What clarity emerges when you don't force anything?
            </p>

            <h3>Final Reflection</h3>
            <p><strong>"How does life move through me when I don't interfere?"</strong><br />
              Use this question as a mirror. Observe your day through this lens. Where do you push? Where do you surrender? What opens when you stop trying to control the current?
            </p>
