  <h3>Module 2: Tokenization</h3>
  <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
  <p>This module introduces you to the process of creating your own token using blockchain technology. You’ll learn how to use the KLY Launchpad to launch tokens with purpose, how smart contracts function, and how supply, name, and utility shape your project’s tokenomics.</p>

  <p><strong>Objectives</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Understand what a token is and its use in Web3 ecosystems.</li>
    <li>Learn how to launch a token using the KLY Launchpad.</li>

    <li>Understand the role of smart contracts and how they govern token behavior.</li>
    <li>Learn how token ownership and distribution impact community trust.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Step-by-Step Instructions</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Access the KLY Launchpad</strong><br>
    Connect your wallet and navigate to the Launchpad section of the KLY platform.</li>

    <li><strong>Enter Token Details</strong><br>
    Choose your token name (e.g., "MyToken"), symbol (e.g., "MTK"), and total supply (e.g., 1,000,000).</li>

    <li><strong>Set Treasury Allocation</strong><br>
    Understand how 5% of the token supply is sent to the KLY Treasury by default. This supports ecosystem growth.</li>

    <li><strong>Launch the Token</strong><br>
    Click the “Launch Token” button and confirm the transaction in your wallet. Your smart contract will be deployed to the BNB Smart Chain.</li>

    <li><strong>Verify on BscScan</strong><br>
    After deployment, verify your token contract and make your project visible and trusted on-chain.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>Tools & Resources</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>KLY Launchpad (kellylegacyestates.com)</li>
    <li>BNB Smart Chain (testnet or mainnet)</li>
    <li>BscScan Token Verification Tool</li>

  </ul>

  <p><strong>Real-World Example</strong></p>
  <p>Kenyetta launches “LegacyToken” using the KLY Launchpad with a 1,000,000 supply and symbol “LGY”. She uses it to give rewards to students, track referrals, and power access to premium course material. The token gains value as her network grows and she integrates staking and liquidity later.</p>

  <p><strong>Optional KLY Integration</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use KLY as a launch requirement (e.g., 10,000 KLY required to deploy a token).</li>
    <li>Offer token rewards in KLY to incentivize user growth or purchases.</li>
