  <h3>Module 2: Tokenization</h3>
  <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
  <p>This module introduces you to the process of creating your own token using blockchain technology. You’ll learn how to use the KLY Launchpad to launch tokens with purpose, how smart contracts function, and how supply, name, and utility shape your project’s tokenomics.</p>

    Click the “Launch Token” button and confirm the transaction in your wallet. Your smart contract will be deployed to the BNB Smart Chain.</li>

    <li><strong>Verify on BscScan</strong><br>
